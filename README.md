**NBA Jersey Game**

Are you a fan of the NBA? If so we have a treat for you! Presenting (DRUM ROLL)...

**NBA Jersey Game.**

This small multiple choice game is built for NBA fans of all levels, whether you casually watch Sports Center to catch up on the highlights from last night, all the way to knowing the newest rookies in the league. The player has a choice of 3 difficulties starting with easy, then progessing to intermediate, only to culminate with the EPIC difficulty level. The user can start at easy and progress through each level as long as you score enough on each phase. They also have to ability to try any level they want at the home page.

This project was built with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. After 50+ hours of working on this Jay and I have gotten it to a presentable point in our eyes. We hope you enjoy our first ever project, keep and eye on our GitHubs, and LinkedIns for updates on this project and also new ones! We have decided to update this game with new features as our skills grow. 

LETS HOOP!
